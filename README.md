![](http://ddi-dev.com/uploads/media/news/0001/01/thumb_505_news_main.jpeg)

Sinatra is a lightweight and simple framework, allowing you to write a web application with the least possible amount of code. It's an open-source and domain-specific language writen in Ruby. Sinatra is a very lightweight framework with few dependencies. Getting started and developing an application are effortless. All you need is to install the gem and require it:

` gem install sinatra `
```
require "sinatra"

get "/hello" do	
  "Hello, Sinatra"	
end
```

Sinatra is great for creating RESTful applications and APIs and provides lots of options for developer to choose from. You can use mix Sinatra with AngularJS or other front-end frameworks or use it alone to create front end. You can use PostgreSQL or SQLite with either ActiveRecord or Data Mapper for ORM. DataMApper is used in this example.
